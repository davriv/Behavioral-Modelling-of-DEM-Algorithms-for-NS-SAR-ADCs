# Behavioral-Modelling-of-DEM-Algorithms-for-NS-SAR-ADCs
Dynamic Element Matching Algorithms behavioral modeling for Noise Shaping SAR ADCs in MATLAB Simulink. Data Weighted Averaging (DWA), First-In-Last-Out DWA and 2nd order Vector Quantizer DEM are presented within the SIMSAR toolbox framework.


The codes will be made publicly available upon the decision of the IEEE ISCAS'26 submission. In the meantime, they can be requested by contacting the author at david.rivera@mcci.ie
